This is a brief overview of the website's functionality for users. There is also an admin section, but I won’t mention it as it would be too lengthy. Currently, the website is no longer accessible because the hosting service requires a fee, and I don’t want to pay for an unnecessary monthly subscription. Only the source code and images remain available for reference. THANKYOU :D 👋
